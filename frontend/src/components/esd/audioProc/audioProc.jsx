        This project focuses on the design and implementation of digital filters
        using VHDL on the Intel Cyclone V FPGA. The objective is to develop both
        low-pass and high-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, which will
        be used for audio signal processing in future applications. The filters
        are implemented using shift registers, multipliers, and adders,
        following a structured design to enable efficient real-time signal
        filtering. A testbench was created using ModelSim to verify the design
        by processing waveform data and comparing results against expected
        outputs. The project integrates knowledge of digital signal processing
        (DSP), hardware description languages, and FPGA-based system design.

        <p>
          The goal of this project wast to design and verify both a high pass
          and a low pass FIR filter in VHDL. These filters will be used to
          process an audio signal in the next lab.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>

        <p>
          The methodology for this project started with creating the VHDL
          implementation. The VHDL implementation centers on a modular audio
          filter system designed to perform real-time digital filtering of
          16-bit audio signals. At the heart of this system is a parameterized
          17-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter that can switch between
          low-pass and high-pass configurations. The architecture consists of
          five primary processes: data input, coefficient loading, shift
          register management, multiplication, and accumulation.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, the data input process determines the destination of incoming
          audio samples, which are written based on address inputs. When the
          address equals zero, the data bypasses filtering; when it is one, the
          input proceeds to the filter logic. Coefficients for both filters are
          hardcoded and selected dynamically using a control signal. A shift
          register (delay line) stores the previous 16 samples of audio input,
          enabling the FIR filter to access past values necessary for
          convolution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Multipliers are generated using a loop that instantiates one
          multiplier per coefficient. Each multiplier takes a delayed input
          sample and multiplies it by the corresponding coefficient. These
          products are then sequentially accumulated using a pipelined adder
          structure. The sum of these values forms the final output sample,
          which is made available to the system through the{" "}
          <code>readdata</code> port. This modular design enables efficient
          parallel processing of filter stages and leverages the spatial
          architecture of the FPGA for real-time performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design was simulated using ModelSim to verify correct behavior.
          Simulations ensured the filters responded correctly to input waveforms
          and switched properly between high-pass and low-pass modes. The
          modular approach and clear signal separation facilitated both
          debugging and extension of the system for future processing tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          To implement real-time audio playback and filtering, the system uses
          embedded C software running on a Nios II processor. The main software
          is located in <code>audio_demo.c</code>, which integrates audio file
          parsing, interrupt handling, and filter control. Audio samples from a
          48kHz, 16-bit stereo WAV file are first read into SDRAM using the{" "}
          <code>read_file()</code> function. This function parses the WAV file
          header and loads audio data into memory, enabling rapid access during
          real-time playback.
        </p>

        <p>
          Real-time playback is managed using a hardware timer configured to
          generate interrupts every 20.83 microsecondsâ€”matching the 48kHz
          sampling rate. Within the <code>timer_isr()</code> interrupt service
          routine, audio samples are read sequentially from SDRAM. If filtering
          is enabled, each sample is passed to the VHDL audio filter IP core
          before being output to the audio interface. The filtered or raw
          samples are written to the audio FIFO for stereo playback.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hardware switches are used to control filtering behavior via the{" "}
          <code>sw_isr()</code>. When switch 0 is active, the system applies a
          low-pass filter by setting the filter control signal to mode 0. If
          switch 1 is toggled, the filter switches to high-pass mode. When both
          switches are active, filtering is bypassed, and the raw audio is
          played. LEDs on the FPGA board indicate the current filter mode,
          providing visual feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the <code>main()</code> function, interrupts are registered for
          both the timer and switch inputs. If <code>FIRST_TIME</code> is
          enabled, the audio file is loaded into SDRAM at startup. The system
          then enters an infinite loop, relying entirely on interrupt-driven
          processing to manage playback and filtering, which minimizes CPU
          overhead and ensures smooth, glitch-free audio output.
        </p>

        <p>
          This embedded-software-driven approach complements the hardware
          design, enabling flexible, real-time control over audio playback and
          processing. By leveraging both VHDL for filtering and C for system
          orchestration, the project demonstrates a practical and effective use
          of FPGA technology in digital signal processing applications.
