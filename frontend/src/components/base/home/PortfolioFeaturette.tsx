            Hello, I'm Diego Lopez!

            <span className="text-gray-500">About Me</span>
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            I am an embedded systems engineer with a deep passion for designing
            and integrating embedded software and hardware. I enjoy taking on
            new challenges and finding innovative and efficient solutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I'm working on a computer vision system that will track a
            tennis ball in Blender and process the image using MATLAB and C++.
            My goal is to blend my skills in embedded systems with artificial
            intelligence to build advanced technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over time, I've developed a love for continuous learning, always
            seeking ways to expand my knowledge and improve the tools I create
            or work with. Whether it's through hands-on projects, team
            collaboration, or self-driven learning, I am always exploring new
            possibilities in both hardware and software development.

            I joined the firmware team in September 2023 and have had the
            opportunity to work on amazing projects and collaborate with
            incredible people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Iâ€™ve worked closely with a team of 3 other firmware engineers to
            write a C++ abstraction layer that integrated the ThreadX RTOS into
            a custom library built on top of the STM32 HAL.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've also collaborated with circuit board designers to ensure the
            functionality of the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) PCB.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I am working with a team of electrical engineers to write
            the firmware for the Low Voltage SubSystem (LVSS) PCB, contributing
            to a critical component of the vehicle's architecture.
